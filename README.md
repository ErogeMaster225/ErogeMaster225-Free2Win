## 0. The OS itself
**Windows** is designed to be as simple as possible. It comes with a user-friendly GUI, great built-in features & tools, it just works out-of-the-box. This come at a cost, though - it's **bloated**. That's why before using Windows I recommend you to debloat the OS.\
Right now i'm using a modified Windows 10 version made by [Ghost Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/c/GHOSTSPECTRE) which disabled/removed some unnecessary features and preinstalled softwares. \
If you don't feel like downloading some sketchy Windows iso from the internet then you can make one yourself with [NTLite](https://www.ntlite.com/) and [MSMG Toolkit](https://msmgtoolkit.in). The process is a bit complicated and I can't explain everything here so you gotta do some research on your own :smile: .
