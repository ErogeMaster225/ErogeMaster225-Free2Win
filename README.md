### a. The OS itself
**Windows** is designed to be as simple as possible. It comes with a user-friendly GUI, great built-in features & tools and just works out-of-the-box. This comes at a cost, though - it's **bloated**. That's why before using Windows I recommend you to debloat the OS.\
Right now i'm using a modified Windows 10 version made by [Ghost Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/c/GHOSTSPECTRE) which disabled/removed some unnecessary features and preinstalled softwares. If you don't feel like downloading some sketchy Windows iso from the internet then you can make one yourself with [NTLite](https://www.ntlite.com/) and [MSMG Toolkit](https://msmgtoolkit.in). The process is a bit complicated and I can't explain everything here so you gotta do some research on your own :smile:.

### b. Package Manager
Of course, installing and updating hundred of programs can be a pain in the ass. That's why many UNIX-like operating systems come with a package manager. On Windows there are [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and [Cholatey](https://chocolatey.org/), each with different aims. [Cholatey](https://chocolatey.org/) allows you to install almost any software you can think of while [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a bit more developer-focused with tons of open-source, command-line developer tools. You can also manually add extra repositories in case you can't find the software you need in [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/). \
Personally, I prefer [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) because it won't pollute my PATH with 2000 entries. If these don't fit you here's also a new kid on the block - [Windows Package Manager](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) (aka Winget). It has a decent software repo but still left a lot to be desired. \
TL;DR: Use package manager. Find one that suits you most or just use a mix of them.
